# Predictive-Maintenance-System-for-Healthcare-Equipment
* Introduction:In healthcare facilities, the reliability of equipment is paramount for ensuring uninterrupted patient care and improving outcomes. Downtime or failures in healthcare equipment can lead to delays in treatment, compromised patient safety, and increased costs. To address these challenges, we propose the development of a Predictive Maintenance System for Healthcare Equipment. This system integrates various data science techniques to predict equipment failures proactively, schedule maintenance, and optimize equipment reliability.
* 3. Methodology

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Sensor Data: Real-time data from various sensors (temperature, pressure, etc.).
NLP on Clinical Records: Extraction of relevant information from maintenance logs and clinical records.
Image Analysis: Analysis of medical images (X-rays, MRIs) to identify anomalies.
The data from datasets are synthetic datasets you can see the datasets at main section files.
Predictive Modeling:

Time-Series Analysis: Forecasting equipment failures based on sensor data trends.
Anomaly Detection: Identifying anomalies in equipment behavior.
Deep Learning Models: Pattern recognition in sensor data and medical images.
Recommender System for Maintenance:

Development of a recommender system for optimal maintenance scheduling.
Ethics and Fairness:

Implementation of fairness-aware algorithms and bias audits.
Visualization and Reporting:

Creation of interactive dashboards.
Generation of detailed reports for stakeholders.
Cloud Deployment: AWS
